# CVs and Cover Letters
This folder contains the CV and cover letter LaTex templates I used for job application.

The templates were built on top of the Awesome-CV package written by [Byungjin Park](https://github.com/posquit0). 

The major effort I made was to make the package compilable under the Windows 10 operation system.

I move the folder /fonts, and two style files into the folder /example and modified the awesome-cv.cls file such that the graph file, profile, and the font collection, can be loaded correctly when the LaTex compiler is running.
