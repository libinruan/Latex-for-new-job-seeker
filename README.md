# CVs and Cover Letters

This folder contains the CV and cover letter Latex templates I used for job application. The templates were built on top of the Awesome-CV package written by [Byungjin Park](https://github.com/posquit0). The major effort I made was to make the package be compliable on the Windows 10 platform, focusing on the `cover letter` template: 

- Move the folder `/fonts`, and style files into the folder `/example` and modified the `awesome-cv.cls` file so that the graph file, the mugshot profile, and the font collection, can be loaded correctly when the compiler is running.
- Add a signature section into the `coverletter.tex` template.
